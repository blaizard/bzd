# Composition

The composition stage brings all components together to compose a running system.

Components might come from the platform used, others are functional to perform tasks related to the application.

Unused components in the build tree are automatically removed.

The composition relies on component inheritance to expose their interface and use composition to inject dependencies.

## C++

The composition in C++ is responsible for bring up and down components.
The dependency graph is automatically generated by the code generator.
