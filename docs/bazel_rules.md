The bzd framework consists of few special rules:
	- bzd_manifest
	- bzd_cc_binary
	- bzd_cc_test

The followign describes the few internal steps used to deploy an application:
	1. binary (generated by any executable rule)
	2. prepare binary (this can be stripped debug info or convert from elf to bin for example)
	3. generate information report
	4. deploy
