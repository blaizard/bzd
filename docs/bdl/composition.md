# Bdl Composition

The composition stage brings all components together to compose a running system.

Components might come from the platform used, others are functional to perform tasks related to the application.

## C++

The composition in C++ is responsible for bring up and down components.
The dependency graph is automatically generated by the code generator which assigns a run level to each top level components.

Here is a little example that illustrates this concept. Here `componentB` depends on `componentA` and `componentC` has no dependencies.
Therefore the code generation will assign a run level 0 to `componentA` and `componentC` and run level 1 to `componentB`.
```bdl
componentA = A()
componentB = B(componentA)
componentC = C()
```

```c++
executor.schedule(componentA, /*runlevel*/0);
executor.schedule(componentB, /*runlevel*/1);
executor.schedule(componentC, /*runlevel*/0);
```
